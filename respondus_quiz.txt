1)  What is the clock speed of a CPU, and how does it affect performance?

*a. The clock speed of a CPU represents the number of instructions it can execute
per second
@ Correct. The clock speed, measured in GHz, determines how many cycles per
second the CPU can execute, which affects its overall performance.

b. The clock speed of a CPU determines the speed of the motherboard
@ Incorrect. The motherboard speed is not directly determined by the CPU's clock
speed.

c. The clock speed of a CPU determines the frequency set by the motherboard
manufacturer
@ Incorrect. The CPU's clock speed is a characteristic of the CPU itself, not
determined by the motherboard manufacturer.

d. The clock speed of the CPU is calculated by the RAM speed
@ Incorrect. CPU clock speed is independent of RAM speed.

2)  What are the two main components of a CPU?

a. FSB and registers
@ Incorrect. The Front-Side Bus (FSB) and registers are not the main functional
components of a CPU.

*b. ALU and control unit
@ Correct. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit are the two main
components of a CPU.

c. Frequency and cache
@ Incorrect. Frequency and cache are important aspects of CPU performance but not
its main components.

d. Cache and FSB
@ Incorrect. While important, cache and FSB are not the primary components of a
CPU.

3)  What is hyper-threading, and how does it affect CPU performance?

a. It allows multiple registers to run instructions at once
@ Incorrect. Hyper-threading is not about multiple registers running
instructions.

b. It accelerates shared cache
@ Incorrect. Hyper-threading is not directly related to accelerating cache.

*c. Allows a single physical CPU core to execute multiple threads simultaneously
@ Correct. Hyper-threading technology allows a single CPU core to handle multiple
threads, improving parallelism and potentially performance.

d. Provisions threads for a single-core CPU to set priority to the CPU core
@ Incorrect. It's not about setting priorities, but about parallel processing
within a single core.

4)  What are the two main connectors used to supply power to the motherboard?

a. 12-pin and 18 pin
@ Incorrect. These are not standard power connector sizes for motherboards.

b. 8-pin and 32 pin
@ Incorrect. 32-pin connectors are not standard for motherboard power.

c. 4/8 pin and 30 pin
@ Incorrect. 30-pin connectors are not standard for motherboard power.

*d. 24-pin and 4/8 pin
@ Correct. The 24-pin main power connector and the 4/8 pin CPU power connector
are standard.

5)  What is a power surge, and how does a power supply protect against it?

a. A loss in power
@ Incorrect. A power surge is an increase, not a decrease in power.

*b. A sudden increase in power
@ Correct. A power surge is a sudden, brief increase in voltage.

c. A dip in power
@ Incorrect. A dip in power is known as a brownout or sag, not a surge.

d. A increase in power consumption
@ Incorrect. A power surge is not about consumption but about an increase in
supply voltage.

6)  Which of the following is Ohm's Law formula?

a. P = V x I
@ Incorrect. This is the formula for electrical power, not Ohm's Law.

b. I = P x V
@ Incorrect. This formula is not correct for any standard electrical calculation.

*c. V = I x R
@ Correct. Ohm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is equal to
the current (I) through it times its resistance (R).

d. R = 1/r + 1/r
@ Incorrect. This is not Ohm's Law; it looks more like a formula for parallel
resistance, but it's not correctly written.

7)  A circuit has a current of 2 amperes and a resistance of 6 ohms. What is the
voltage across the circuit?

a. 3 volts
@ Incorrect. This is not the correct application of Ohm's Law.

b. 10 volts
@ Incorrect. This value does not match the correct calculation of voltage using
Ohm's Law.

c. 24 volts
@ Incorrect. This value does not correctly follow from Ohm's Law.

*d. 12 volts
@ Correct. According to Ohm's Law (V = I x R), the voltage is 2 amperes x 6 ohms
= 12 volts.

8)  A circuit has a resistance of 8 ohms and a voltage of 24 volts. What is the
current flowing through the circuit?

a. 2 amps
@ Incorrect. This value does not match the correct calculation using Ohm's Law.

*b. 3 amps
@ Correct. According to Ohm's Law (I = V / R), the current is 24 volts / 8 ohms =
3 amps.

c. 4 amps
@ Incorrect. This value is not consistent with Ohm's Law.

d. 1 amps
@ Incorrect. This value does not correctly follow from Ohm's Law.

9)  What is the difference between a 32-bit and a 64-bit CPU architecture?

*a. The amount of memory it can handle
@ Correct. The key difference is in the amount of memory they can address, with
64-bit CPUs being able to address significantly more memory than 32-bit CPUs.

b. The number of CPU cycles
@ Incorrect. The difference is not in the number of CPU cycles.

c. The number of controls signals it can handle
@ Incorrect. The difference is not primarily in the number of control signals.

d. The amount of concurrent transactions
@ Incorrect. The primary difference is related to memory addressing, not
concurrent transactions.

10)  What is the main unit of measurement for power supply output?

a. Volts
@ Incorrect. Volts measure electrical potential, not power output.

b. Amps
@ Incorrect. Amps measure current, not power.

*c. Wattage
@ Correct. Wattage (watts) is the unit of measurement for power.

d. Ohms
@ Incorrect. Ohms measure resistance, not power.
